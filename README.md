## ✨ How To Use This Repo

Most interview resources are either too scattered or too theoretical. This repo is organized around three practical tracks:

| Track | Best for | Start here |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Core System Design** | Distributed systems, cloud/platform, APIs, storage, scaling | [docs/](docs/) |
| **AI & Machine Learning** | ML system design, agents, classic ML, deep learning, LLMs | [docs/machine-learning/README.md](docs/machine-learning/README.md) |
| **Reference & Practice Appendix** | Templates, cheat sheets, LeetCode patterns, LLD | [docs/reference/README.md](docs/reference/README.md) |

Use the interactive site when you want navigation, quiz mode, and progress tracking. Use the Markdown docs when you want dense references you can skim before an interview.

## 🚀 What Makes It Useful

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 **48 interview-ready topics** | Core system design, cloud/platform, AI/ML, security, and interview reference material |
| 🌙 **Dark / Light mode** | Persisted preference, instant toggle with `d` |
| ✅ **Progress tracking** | Mark topics as read. Your progress saves locally. |
| 🔖 **Bookmarks** | Save topics to revisit. Accessible from any page. |
| 🃏 **Quiz / Flashcard mode** | Randomized flashcard review across all 48 topics |
| 📖 **Inline reader** | Read every topic without leaving the page — with prev/next navigation |
| ⌨️ **Keyboard-first** | `/` search, `q` quiz, `b` bookmarks, `?` shortcuts |
| 📊 **Visual progress bar** | See your overall completion at a glance |
| 🗺️ **3 learning paths** | Beginner, Mid-Level, and Advanced tracks |
| 🔍 **Live search** | Searches title, category, summary, and tags |
| 🎨 **Category color coding** | Every domain has its own visual identity |
| 🚀 **Zero setup** | Open in browser. No install. No build step. |

## 📖 Recommended Topic Structure

The strongest docs in this repo use a consistent interview-prep structure. Not every legacy page is identical yet, but new and upgraded docs aim to follow this pattern:

```markdown
## Problem
What are we solving? When does this come up in an interview?

## Options
What are the main approaches? (with trade-off table)

## Recommended Default
What to pick and why, with the specific caveats.

## Failure Modes
What breaks? How do you detect and recover?

## Metrics
What do you measure to know it's working?

## Interview Answer Sketch
The concise 2-minute answer you'd give under time pressure.
```
